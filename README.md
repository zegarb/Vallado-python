# Vallado-python

First cut of a port of Dr Vallado's Fundamentals of Astrodynamics and Applications companion code from MATLAB to Python. Source material can be found here: https://celestrak.org/software/vallado-sw.php . Special thanks to Dr Vallado for his guidance and support.

Exercises mostly work, but testing has been minimal. That will change in the next few weeks as we move to the testing phase.

Code that was not working in MATLAB or was missing functions was banished to the dungeon to be addressed later.
