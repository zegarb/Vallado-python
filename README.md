# Vallado-python

First cut of a port of Dr Vallado's Fundamentals of Astrodynamics and Applications companion code from MATLAB to Python. Source material can be found here: https://celestrak.org/software/vallado-sw.php . Special thanks to Dr Vallado for his guidance and support.

Example files mostly work, but testing has been minimal. That will change in the next few weeks as we move to the testing phase. Current state of example test can be found here:

There are a total of about 200 functions. Code that was not working in MATLAB or was missing functions was banished to the dungeon to be addressed later.

A list of some of the algorithms and associated book info can be found here:
